## TL;DR

This repository contains the code implementing in C++ our method described in our publication [Improving the Spatial Reuse in IEEE 802.11ax WLANs: A Multi-Armed Bandit Approach](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3479239.3485715), with a test infrastructure built on the open-source network simulator [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org/). We provided it to ease replications and experiments with our algorithms.

## Repository architecture

The repository contains two folders:

* `ns-allinone-3.31` refers to the source code of ns-3 simulator,
* `scratch` contains our C++ code along with some resources:
	* `scratch/nsTest/img` contains the visualizations used in our publication
	* `scratch/nsTest/topos` contains some network topologies to test our method on

The `scratch` repository will be replicated in `ns-allinone-3.31/ns-3.31/scratch`, were the file generated by the simulations will be written. See the section below for more details.


## Usage

The repository contains a Makefile able to download `ns-3.31`, build it and launch our code within the simulator, with the command:
```
make
```
If you already dispose of the built simulator in `ns-3.31`, you can avoid downloading and building again the simulator by using:
```
make test
```

Once this command is launched, the C++ code in `scratch/nsTest` will be executed. To test the method, the code replicates a given number of simulations in parallel, with the same simulation parameters. Once a simulation terminates, it will write a few files using the template `TOPO_DURATION_OPT_SAMP_REW_TEST_XXX.csv`, where:
* `TOPO` is the name of the topology
* `DURATION` is the duration of the simulation, in seconds
* `OPT` is the optimizer ID
* `SAMP` is the sampler ID
* `REW` is the reward ID
* `TEST` is the duration of a test, in seconds
* `XXX` is the metric contained in the file, which can be:
	* `aps` the APs throughputs,
	* `conf` the configurations used,
	* `cum` the cumulated throughput,
	* `fair` the fairness,
	* `rew` the reward,
	* `stas` the STAs throughputs

The produced files are `.csv`, with as many columns as the number of tests made, and as many lines as the number of simulations replicated. One can then open them with some data analysis library like `pandas` and visualize the data.
